# CS_250 Software Development Lifecycle

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
  An important part of software developement is making programs that users actually want
to use, otherwise there would be no point in developing the software. Gathering and crating
user stories is a great way to make sure the code you are creating actually has a purpose. A
use storie is gathered from the user themselves in order to determine exactly what the user, or 
a group of users wants. 

## How Do I Approach Developing Programs?
  I Like developing programs in efficient ways. I do not enjoy writing repetitive code, or code
that will need to be revised in the future. I really look forward to encorporating the sprints that 
agile has into my future coding process. By creasting short sprints of project goals I can manage my
time better and ensure that I am writing code that will serve a purpose in the greater picture of the
project. By sprint planning in the beginning I can see how that bigger picture is completed through the
completion of shorter sprints and make my way towards the end of the project sprint by sprint.

## What Does It Mean To Be Good Team Member In Software Development?
  I think in order to be a good team member in software development you really need to have no ego. 
Nobody really likes being told they are wrong about something or that their is a better way to do something
than the way they like to do it. However, that is just the process of learning, you want people to be able 
to tell you when you are incorrect so you can learn from it and fix it for the future. Having an ego will 
always get in the way of progress as team members begin to resent working with you since you do not take 
constructive criticism well. Nobody wants to work with someeone who does not want to actually be on a team
and thinks they are better than everyone else.
